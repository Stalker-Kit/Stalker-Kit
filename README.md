# Stalker-Kit
The main goal of Stalker Kit is to build a easy to use platform for social networks Web Scraping and automation, suited for individuals ranging from a "casual" stalker to someone that wants to do big data analysis in large data-sets.

This software is a working in progress and at this moment only have a few features, *We want this to be the base for social networks data scraping and automation*. We would be glad if you use our code in your next software but even happier if you share your progress with us, we encourage everyone to become part of this project.
